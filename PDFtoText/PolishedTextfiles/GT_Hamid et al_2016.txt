Abstract: The life history and the influence of environmental parameters on Thalerosphyrus were investigated in two first-order rivers—the Batu Hampar River and the Teroi River of Gunung Jerai, Kedah—in northern peninsular Malaysia. Based on nymphal body length, Thalerosphyrus was found to be trivoltine in both rivers, regardless of the altitudinal difference, but its population abundance was four times higher in the Teroi River, presumably related to its better survival in the lower water temperature. At least nine instars of Thalerosphyrus were detected in the field-collected nymphs. Its life cycle was completed within 2.5–3.0 months, with overlapping cohorts and continual emergence of up to 3 months. The main driving factors of the high abundance of Thalerosphyrus were the water temperature and habitat quality.

INTRODUCTION 
 
Studies of life history are important to explicate the structure, function, and behavior of an organism, and it is useful to compare the growth rates of natural individuals between populations (Benke 1970). Such comparisons are useful in determining variation among population growth rates, as influenced by environmental factors, such as temperature and altitude. When anthropogenic disturbances occur, life histories change and adapt to a particular situation (Lopez-Rodriguez et al. 2008). The most significant environmental factor affecting life-history patterns, especially growth rates and the seasonal timing of aquatic insects, is water temperature, based on previous studies by Sweeney and Vannote (1984), Sweeney (1984), and Jackson and Sweeney (1995). In general, aquatic insects grow faster and produce more generations (voltinism) in warmer water than those living in colder waters. Variations in the instar stages in a life cycle explicate differences in the mayfly life history of different cohorts (Ruffieux et al. 1999) living in different environments. In central Japan, Miyairi and Tojo (2007) found that Bleptus fasciatus (Heptageniidae) in the Matsumoto headwater area had a semivoltine life cycle, while Gonzalez et al. (2003) reported a bivoltine life cycle for Epeorus torrentium in the lowland Agüera stream basin in Spain, with water temperatures ranging from 6.3°C to 20.3°C. Most of the mayflies in Hong Kong, such as Ephemera (Heptageniidae), are univoltine (Dudgeon 1999). However, Kuroda et al. (1984) reported that Ephemera orientalis has three generations in a year, while Watanabe (1992) showed that the species is Bivoltine in Japan.  
Concomitantly, several studies on the life histories of aquatic 
invertebrates have been carried out worldwide, but very few studies have 
focused on the influence of altitude on the communities of aquatic invertebrates. 
Life history studies are advantageous in determining the influence of 
environmental factors on growth rates of similar species at different altitudes 
(Benke 1970). In general, the low temperatures at higher altitudes have been 
hypothesized to affect the life history strategies and productivity of aquatic 
insects (Wallace & Anderson 1996). Higher altitudes have cooler temperatures, 
which may reduce the numbers of generations per year in mayflies (Clifford 1982; 
Newbold et al. 1994). A comprehensive study by Heise et al. (1987) showed that 
the burrowing mayfly, Hexagenia limbata, had a linear relationship between 
voltinism and latitudinal location. In Korean streams, the mayfly Ephemera often 
presents a unique pattern of altitudinal distribution (Lee et al. 1995, 1996, 2008).  
Research on the life history and production of river insects has increased 
extensively, with most studies centered on species in temperate regions, for 
example in France (Cayrou & Cereghino 2003), Brazil (Fonseca Leal & de Assis 
Esteves 2000), Spain (Gonzalez et al. 2001, 2003) and Idaho, USA (Robinson & 
Minshall 1998; Taylor & Kennedy 2006). In the Asian region, such information is 
comparatively scarce (Benke 1993; Chung 2005). In fact, there is a great 
variability in the life cycles among species (Clifford 1982). The genus 
Thalerosphyrus is widely distributed in peninsular Malaysia. The majority of 
Thalerosphyrus inhabit upstream rivers of peninsular Malaysia. The nymph has a 
relatively large body size in the final instar (Yule & Yong 2004). Its flat head and 
stout femora contribute to its successful existence, potentially the most 
productive mayfly species in the cool water of medium to fast-flowing streams in 
the headwater ecosystem.  
In this study, the life history of Thalerosphyrus was investigated in two 
rivers with different altitudes that flow down from Gunung Jerai. This study was 
designed to evaluate the growth of the Thalerosphyrus nymph, the number of 
instars, the size of each instar (population dynamics), and the life cycle for a one-
year duration. The variations in the rivers' physico-chemical parameters were 
expected to affect the growth performances and population dynamics of this 
species in the rivers.

MATERIALS AND METHODS 
 
Sampling Site 
This study was carried out in two rivers, the Batu Hampar and Teroi rivers of 
Gunung Jerai Forest Reserve in the state of Kedah, in northern peninsular 
Malaysia. The location of the rivers relative to sea level was recorded using 
Global Positioning System versatile navigator (GPS map 76 CSX Garmin®, 
Kansas, USA). Batu Hampar River is located in the Yan district and runs through 
a populated village and fruit orchards in a lowland dipterocarp forest at 300 m 
above sea level (asl). The sampling activities for this study took place at 
N5°46.668’ E100°23.835’. The Teroi River is situated high up on the Gunung 
Jerai at 1214 m asl. The sampling point was determined to be N5°48.328’ 
E100°25.913’. 
 
River Physical Measurements 
Physical measurements of the rivers were taken concurrently with the 
Thalerosphyrus collection every month from September 2007 to August 2008. 
The river’s physical characteristics, such as width, depth, hydrogenic potential 
(pH), water temperature, and water velocity were obtained in situ using an 
electronic pH meter (HACH Co., Loveland, CO, USA) and a portable Velocity 
Autoflow Watch (JDC Instrument, Arizona, USA). In situ measurements of the 
width and depth were recorded using a measuring tape (3.2 m/12 feet). 
 
Collection and Measurements of Thalerosphyrus 
A modified kick-sampling technique of Merritt and Cummins (1996) was used to 
collect 20 samples of Thalerosphyrus monthly from September 2007 to August 
2008. A detailed explanation of the sampling. Procedure can be found elsewhere 
(Suhaila & Che Salmah 2011). The kick-sampling technique requires a D-pond 
net frame (300 µm mesh, 40 cm width and 30 cm height with a 60 cm long cone-
shaped net) fitted to a 105 cm long handle. The opening of the D-pond net, which 
faces upstream, was held vertically against the flow of the water. The nymphs 
that detached from the substrates drifted into the net. Aquatic insect larvae on 
pebbles, cobbles and woody debris were gently rubbed or scraped and collected 
inside the net. The samples were brought back to the laboratory for identification. 
The Thalerosphyrus were identified using the keys of Yule and Yong (2004), 
Dudgeon (1999), and Morse et al. (1994). Identification was accomplished up to 
genus level only, as there was no key for the Malaysian Ephemeroptera species. 
Furthermore, the Thalerosphyrus species probably would be the same in these 
two rivers, as these rivers are located in the same district in Kedah state, 
peninsular Malaysia. The body length of the Thalerosphyrus nymphs was 
measured from the anterior margin of the head to the posterior margin of the 
tenth abdominal tergite (excluding caudal filaments) with a digital caliper (0–125 
mm). As proposed by Miyairi and Tojo (2007), the head width of each nymph was 
measured across the widest portion of the head capsule from the left to the right 
outer margins of the compound eyes to the nearest 0.1 mm under a dissecting 
microscope coupled with an Olympus Series image analyzer (Olympus Optical 
Co., Tokyo).

Nymphal body lengths were classified accordingly to separate their instar 
stages, as suggested by Miyairi and Tojo (2007). The life cycle of Thalerosphyrus 
was approximated through an analysis of the size-frequency distribution based 
on the disparity in the frequency of nymphal body lengths of all individuals 
collected over a year (Fonseca Leal & de Assis Esteves 2000). To classify the 
Thalerosphyrus larval development, larval body size classes were categorized 
into 0.5 mm intervals for head capsule width and 1.5 mm intervals for larva body 
length. 
Miyairi and Tojo (2007) and Benke (1970) suggested a categorization of 
nymphal body lengths to separate instar stages for insects with an unknown 
number of instars in their life cycle. In this method, the number of instar stages 
was determined by counting backwards from the final instar with no successive 
moulting (hence, designated as F), followed by the second-to-the-last instar (F-1) 
until the newly emerged nymph. The final instar is assigned an F stage (or F0 = 
age 0) because an adult emerges without requiring another molt. The 
subsequent lower instars are accordingly assigned to stages following similar 
assumptions.  

Data Analysis 
Differences in the water-parameter values in the two rivers were analyzed using 
the Mann-Whitney test at p = 0.005 for non-normally distributed data 
(Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, p<0.005). Spearman’s rho correlation and linear 
regression analysis were used to determine the relationship between the water 
parameters and Thalerosphyrus abundance and life history. To assign intervals 
for the instar stages, the size frequency histogram and Discriminant Function 
Analysis were used on all individuals collected over a year. All analysis was 
conducted using the Statistical Package for Social Science (SPSS) version 22®.   
Meanwhile, for each sampling month, the number of mean instars was 
determined using a formula proposed by Snedecor and Cochran (1967) and 
Benke (1970) to estimate the population growth in each habitat. As the 
population was fairly asynchronous, especially in the Batu Hampar River, the 
growth curve was smoothed by eye using a three-point moving average, as 
suggested by Snedecor and Cochran (1967), for general comparisons. The mean 
instar numbers (R) were plotted against time for each river using the following

RESULTS 
 
Environmental Conditions 
Features of the hydrographic and hydrologic parameters in both rivers for the 12 
months of sampling are shown in Table 1. The Teroi River is located at a 
relatively high altitude (1214 asl), and the water temperature ranged from 
19.2°C–21.3°C. In the Batu Hampar River (300 m asl), the water was slightly 
warmer (23.5°C–25.2°C). The Batu Hampar River is a moderately wide river 
(4.73 ± 0.4 m mean width) with a 0.34 ± 0.06 m mean depth. The water flow in 
this river is relatively fast (0.65 ± 0.1 m/s). The Teroi River is a shallow river (0.17 
± 0.07 m mean depth) with a 4.03 ± 0.7 m mean width. The water velocity of 1.22 
± 0.123 m/s is the fastest among all rivers because the river flows over a steep 
slope. The water in the Teroi River was more acidic (4.97 ± 0.21) than that in the 
Batu Hampar River (6.06 ± 0.11). The results of the Mann-Whitney U test 
showed that the monthly water velocity (z = 143.0, p = 0.002), water depth                   
(z = 45.5, p = 0.04), pH (z = 22.0, p = 0.001), chemical oxygen demand (COD)              
(z = 130.5, p = 0.016), and total suspended solid (TSS) (z = 169.0, p = 0.00) 
were significantly different between the rivers. Out of six parameters analyzed, 
only water velocity showed significant correlation with Thalerosphyrus abundance 
(r = 0.450, p<0.05) and ammonia had positive correlation with the number of 
instar (r = 0.475, p<0.05). In the same way, the temperature explained 20.3% of 
the variability in Thalerosphyrus abundance (F = 10.66, p = 0.002). The velocity 
and ammonia concentrations failed to meet the selection criteria, as indicated by 
a non-significant t-value (p>0.05). The abundance of Thalerosphyrus did not 
show temporal differences as the Kruskal-Wallis test (x2 = 8.51) was not 
significant at p = 0.05.

Separation of Thalerosphyrus Nymphs into Instar Classes 
Overall, a total of 139 individuals from the Batu Hampar River and 603 individuals 
from the Teroi River were used to construct nymphal instar categories. There 
was a strong relationship between body length and head capsule width in both 
rivers (Batu Hampar River, R2 = 0.722, p = 0.003, and Teroi River, R2 = 0.714,         
Suhaila Ab. Hamid et al. 
 
48 
p = 0.023). The separation of instar stages and supported by the discriminant 
function analysis (DFA) (Table 2 and Fig. 1) resulted in a class interval of 0.5 mm 
head capsule width and 1.5 mm body length for all nymphal instars (Table 2). 
DFA found 2 discriminant functions that were statistically significant at the 95% 
confidence level (Table 3). The first variate eigenvalue was 99.8%, whereas the 
second variate only accounted for 0.02%. Based on a Wilks lambda calculation 
and DFA scatter plot (Fig. 1), nine instar stages were formed. Based on the 
constructed instar stages histograms and DFA in each river, nine Thalerosphyrus 
instars were distinguished; F–F-8 (Table 2, Figs. 2, 3, 4, and 5). The nymphal 
body length ranged from 2.0 to 15.4 mm (F-8–F), with head capsule width ranged 
from 0.5 to 4.9 mm in both rivers (Table 2). 
The growth of the Thalerosphyrus populations in the two rivers is shown 
by the distribution of the m ean instars in Figure 6. In general, the Thalerosphyrus 
population grew almost at the same rate in both rivers. The positive growth rates 
should be read downwards because the negative signs were removed from the 
number of instars on the Y-axis. The highest value (instar 8) represents the 
youngest instar.

Development of Thalerosphyrus Nymphs in the Rivers 
The maximum abundance of Thalerosphyrus was documented at F-3 instar in the 
Batu Hampar River (Fig. 7), and at F-6, F-5, and F-4 (Fig. 8) in the Teroi River. A 
new generation of Thalerosphyrus in the Batu Hampar River began in October 
2007, indicated by the appearance of very young nymphs (F-8) in the collection. 
They grew to F-2 instar in November 2007, and adult emergence was suspected 
to occur soon after. The population remained low, and only slightly larger instars 
were collected in January 2008. A younger instar (F-6) was collected in February, 
March, April and May 2008. In May, however, some nymphs had developed to 
the penultimate instar (F-1), which signaled another adult emergence. There was 
a potential adult emergence in August 2008 with the appearance of F-1 in the 
sample. Therefore, in this river, the species was likely to be trivoltine. 
In the Teroi River (Fig. 8), the smallest instar of Thalerosphyrus (F-8) 
was collected in September 2007. These nymphs grew to F-1 and F instar in 
November 2007 to January 2008 and June 2008. An adult emergence was 
expected during this month and through January 2008. At the same times, young 
instars (F-7) continuously entered the population, implying an asynchronous 
development of the nymphs and hence the presence of overlapping cohorts. An 
emergence of a large Thalerosphyrus population was predicted in March 2008, 
and another small emergence was expected to commence in June 2008. 
Frequent rains and harsh spates at the beginning of the wet season in July 2008 
could have killed or drifted all the small nymphs downstream; consequently, there 
was no collection for the month, and a very small population of Thalerosphyrus 
was observed in August 2008. F-3 and F-2 populations were recovered from this 
river in June 2008. Their development patterns indicated that an emergence likely 
started in the river. Beginning in June 2008, when the largest larvae were collected, the population was low in August 2008. Based on this result, there was a strong possibility that the three generations of Thalerosphyrus occurred in a single year (trivoltine) in the Teroi River.

DISCUSSION

The exclusion of Thalerosphyrus between the high and low altitude rivers became apparent during the study. As described previously, the Teroi River is located at the peak of Gunung Jerai, and the water temperature is cooler than that in the Batu Hampar River (low altitude); thus, the abundance of Thalerosphyrus is greater in the Teroi River. The same shifts in Heptageniidae family density were reported by Gonzalez et al. (2003), Bargos et al. (1990), Graca et al. (1989), and Wohl et al. (1995). The first factor that contributes to the higher abundance of Thalerosphyrus is likely the water temperature. Low water temperature seemed to favor Thalerosphyrus abundance. According to Vannote and Sweeney (1980) and Newbold et al. (1994), temperature is the major ecological factor that affects the development of the eggs and nymphs of mayflies and influences ephemeropteran densities throughout their growth (Brittain 1990; Cereghino & Lavandier 1998). In this study, the Teroi River was found to be a better habitat that accommodated a four times higher abundance of Thalerosphyrus (603 individuals) than the Batu Hampar River (139 individuals). At 1214 m asl, the Teroi River had lower mean water temperatures (20.9 ± 0.3°C) throughout the year than the Batu Hampar River (mean temperature 24.2 ± 0.1°C), which explained the influence of temperature in regulating population abundance of this genus in the Gunung Jerai.   
The development patterns of a few mayflies in the current study were significantly correlated with water temperature, particularly in the tropical region where the temperature was high. The relationship between Thalerosphyrus abundance and mean temperature was statistically significant (p<0.05), with the water temperature in the Teroi River lower than that of the other river studied. The Teroi River had lower mean water temperatures than the Batu Hampar River throughout the year. Indeed, in terms of numbers and their composition in the river, Thalerosphyrus had more success in the Teroi River than in the Batu Hampar River. Water temperature is a major factor determining egg development and nymphal growth in the ephemeropteran life history (Clifford 1982; Brittain 1990). Kukula (1997) found that Rhithrogena iridina in the Terebowiec stream, Poland, had a univoltine life cycle collected at 900 m asl with a water temperature range from 1.0°C to 14.8°C. Moreover, in the Lissuraga stream, France, the same species had a bivoltine life cycle because of the higher water temperature in the Lissuraga stream during the time period when the study was conducted (Thibault 1971 in Gonzalez et al. 2003). Moreover, Benke (1998) mentioned that the growth rate of mayflies in the Ogeechee River, Georgia, was shown to increase with temperature (mostly >22°C). 
Evidence from the nymphal collections showed that at least three generations of Thalerosphyrus (trivoltine) occurred in both the Batu Hampar and Teroi rivers. In this case, an altitudinal difference of 900 m between the two rivers did not influence species voltinism. In temperate areas, an altitude that negatively corresponds with water temperature was proven to be the most important factor in determining growth and development (Graca et al. 1989; Bargos et al. 1990; Suhaila Ab. Hamid et al. Wohl et al. 1995; Gonzalez et al. 2003), thus explaining the number er of mayfly 
generations occurring in a year.  
Several studies have indicated the importance of altitude in determining 
the voltinism of Heptageniidae, as well as other ephemeropteran families. This 
factor, however, is strongly linked to the temperature that affects their growth 
rate. Yan and Li (2007) found that at 450 m asl (15.4°C), Epeorus sp. in Hubei, 
China, has two generations in a year. Bleptus fasciatus (Ephemeroptera: 
Heptageniidae) in Matsumoto, Japan showed a semivoltine life cycle at an 
altitude of 840 m (Miyairi & Tojo 2007). Humpesch (1979) in Austria proved the 
existence of a univoltine Baetis alpine at an altitude of 1355 m asl and a bivoltine 
at an altitude of 615 m asl. In this research, the variation in altitude did not alter 
the growth of Thalerosphyrus due to the small variation in the water temperature. 
Thalerosphyrus developed at the same rate in both rivers and consequently had 
the same number of generations.  
Apart from having a colder water temperature, the riverbed of the Teroi 
River consists of bedrock, a very stable substrate with considerably fast water 
flow (mean of 1.22 ± 0.123 m/s). Such a substrate is highly preferred by the 
nymphs of Thalerosphyrus (Lee et al. 1996), justifying their high occurrence in 
the river.  
Predators, particularly fish, play a role in the Thalerosphyrus sp. 
community. Several authors working on aquatic environments (Crowl et al. 1997; 
Rosenfeld 1997) have stated the importance of ephemeropteran nymphs as a 
dietary item for many fish species. From personal observations in the Teroi River, 
there were no fish seen at the sampling site. In low pH water and steep slopes, 
fish (the predators) are uncommon (Amir Shah Ruddin et al. 2009), which 
therefore results in a higher survival rate of the Thalerosphyrus nymphs. Hence, 
this could be a reason for the higher number of individuals of the Thalerosphyrus 
in Teroi River than in the other river. In the Batu Hampar River, there were many 
species of fish, for example, Channa striata, Channa gachua, Amblyceps 
foratum, Devario regina, Betta pugnax, Neolissochilus hendersoni and 
Monopterus albus (Amir Shah Ruddin et al. 2009). This is probably the largest 
factor contributing to the lower abundance of Thalerosphyrus in the Batu Hampar 
River than in the Teroi River. Likewise, the Batu Hampar River was located near 
to a durian (Durio zibethinus) and local fruit plantation, providing a habitat for bats 
and birds that might also be predators (of the adults) and further decrease their 
number in the Batu Hampar River.  
The results from this study showed that Thalerosphyrus nymphs 
asynchronously developed in approximately 10 to 12 weeks (2.5–3.0 months), 
from small instar to subimago, in both the Teroi River and Batu Hampar Rivers. 
This result was comparable to that of a study in Tamil Nadu, where the Epeorus 
sp. (Heptageniidae) took 2–3 months to complete their life cycle (Sivaruban et al. 
2010). A study by Fonseca Leal and de Assis Esteves (2000) estimated an 
interval 
of 
13–17 
weeks 
for 
Campsurus 
notatus 
(Ephemeroptera: 
Polymitarcyidae) to become adults in an Amazonian lake. Meanwhile, Epeorus 
torrentium (Heptageniidae) took 20–24 weeks to become adults in a cold north 
Iberian Stream, in Spain (Gonzalez et. al 2003). The difference was probably due

to the duration for egg laying and hatching in this species (Epeorus torrentium), 
which was more extended (3 months) than that of Thalerosphyrus.  
The same conclusion was suggested in a previous paper on the life 
history of Caenis luctuosa (Caenidae) in the Aguera stream in northern Spain 
(Gonzalez et al. 2001). Peran et al. (1999) declared that non-seasonal 
multivoltine life histories were dependent on location. In this study, the first 
nymph of Thalerosphyrus was collected in September 2007 in both selected 
rivers. There were nine instars (F-8, F-7, F-6, F-5, F-4, F-3, F-2, F-1, F) and the 
F-6 and F-5 stages constituted 70% of the population. The first cohort of 
Thalerosphyrus that started To emerge in September could be regarded as conservative. The author has examined adults of the Heptageniidae family, which she collected herself every month throughout the year. Miyairi and Tojo (2007) discovered that the emergence of the mayfly Bleptus fasciatus (Heptageniidae) occurs from early June to late July only. The difference is likely due to the differences in climate because Japan is colder than Malaysia.  
In this study, the Thalerosphyrus had nine instars. Needham et al. (1935) revealed that the Epeorus fragilis (Heptageniidae) had 11 instars in North America, and Kondratieff and Voshell (1980) found that Stenonema modestum (Heptageniidae) had at least 14 to 15 instars in Virginia, USA. By using the mean instar technique, there was a possibility to detect significant differences in the growth for Thalerosphyrus at each river. At this point, this technique simply showed an accurate method for demonstrating growth and giving estimates of the time spent in the various instars (Benke 1970) from field data, as many variables cannot be measured easily in the field. It was difficult to determine the precise number of instars because the growth rates cannot readily be determined from field sampling due to their asynchronous development (wide age spread of individuals). Additionally, it was very difficult to collect the first instar, probably because of the size and structure of the nymphs; they were too small and too fragile to be handled; therefore, the small nymphs were not included in the size class calculations. As stated by Needham et al. (1935), the first instar is minute and can be obtained by hatching the eggs in the laboratory. They found that the newly hatched Stenonema interpunctatum (Heptageniidae) nymph measured less than 0.5 mm in length. Hence, due to the small size of the newly hatched nymph and the use of net mesh during sampling in this study, the nymphs would definitely escape. Mayfly eggs may directly hatch, but small nymphs are hard to collect from the field (Humpesch 1980; Chung 2005). The first nymphal stage that was trapped in the net during sampling is probably the third instar nymph, which can be distinguished by its flattened legs, strongly developed femora and spines along the hind margin. Additionally, the growth rate and the number of nymphal instars in mayflies were affected by the environmental conditions, especially the water temperature (Vannote & Sweeney 1980; Giberson & Rosenberg 1992) and food (Cianciara 1979). 
Regarding the synchronization, the Thalerosphyrus population was more synchronous in the Teroi River than in the Batu Hampar River. This is likely because more individuals were collected in the Teroi River, which is shown by the separated bar. Accordingly, the life history of Thalerosphyrus was asynchronous in both the studied rivers, with extended overlapping instar stages. Suhaila Ab. Hamid et al.

Studying the life history of Thalerosphyrus flowersi in Kumbakkarai stream, Tamil Nadu, India, Sivaruban et al. (2010) found that T. flowersi are multivoltine, with asynchronous and continuous emergence. The potential for overlap in mayflies was significantly increased compared to other insects because of their large numbers of instars and known developmental variability (Fink 1984). Nymphs of various sizes occurred throughout the sampling duration. This has also been shown in Bleptus fasciatus (Heptageniidae) (Miyairi & Tojo 2007) and Epeorus torrentium (Heptageniidae) (Gonzalez et al. 2003), which displayed asynchronous patterns. 
The asynchronous life histories of Thalerosphyrus observed in the Batu Hampar and Teroi rivers could be explained as a result of the uncertain spates that occurred. Other authors (Robinson & Minshall 1998) have associated asynchronous life histories with changing and unpredictable flow regimes. Asynchronous development was widespread among aquatic insects because synchronization reduced cannibalism and access to food sources (Willis & Hendricks 1992; Willis et al. 1995). According to Benke (1970), the variation of 
growth (synchronization) in insect species throughout the year was dependent on 
environmental factors, such as temperature and food availability. Jackson and 
Sweeney (1995) recorded the development of 35 insect species of the orders 
Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, Trichoptera, and Chironomidae in Costa Rican 
streams that had an annual range of water temperature of 20°C–23°C, and most 
of the taxa had multivoltine life cycles (32 of 35 taxa).  
The lack of a positive increment in the Thalerosphyrus population growth 
curves was related to the asynchronous population and thus the presence of 
overlapping cohorts in both rivers. This pattern of growth is characteristic of 
insects in tropical rivers, as previously observed in other heptageniids, Bleptus 
fasciatus (Heptageniidae) (Miyairi & Tojo 2007) and Epeorus torrentium, 
(Gonzalez et al. 2003) and dragonfly populations (Che Salmah et al. 2006). The 
potential for overlapping cohorts in mayflies was greatly increased compared to 
other insects because of their large numbers of instars and known developmental 
variability (Fink 1984).  
The life cycles of Thalerospyrus become apparent in the Batu Hampar 
River because nymphs of various instars were collected all the time. This may be 
related to the monthly number of instars collected. Numerous nymphs of various 
instars were represented monthly, showing that this genus was well dispersed in 
the Batu Hampar River.  
Development instars F-6, F-5, F-4, and F-3 were well represented during 
the dry season (January to July 2008) in all the studied rivers, most likely 
because they were bigger instars and the low water level was suitable for their 
emergence and oviposition. In reference to the influence of the physical river 
factors, the water level and substrate stability affected the migration of the 
Thalerosphyrus nymphs (Taylor & Kennedy 2006). The temporal differences of 
abundance in the current study were believed to be the consequences of 
different seasons. According to Miyairi and Tojo (2007), season is the major 
ecological factor affecting the development of mayflies and influencing 
ephemeropteran densities throughout their growth (Cereghino & Lavandier 
1998). The growth patterns of a few mayflies in this study were not significantly 
correlated with seasons, especially in the tropical region. As the water level 
decreased, which was caused by the dry season, the instar development 
continued (F-2 to F) in May and June and began to emerge in late June, peaking 
in July. The high abundance of Thalerosphyrus in the dry season is expected to 
result in continuous egg hatching and instar development. The low abundance in 
July 2008 was likely the result of successful oviposition and emergence.  
Spates and drying events were the common disturbances of rivers in the 
tropical region. It seemed that Thalerosphyrus was resistant to spates and 
maintained individuals in all development classes throughout the year. However, 
Miller and Golladay (1996) found that Caenis (Caenidae) and other mayflies were 
resistant to spates in south-central Oklahoma due to their ability to persist in 
intermittent pools and find refugia during spates (Taylor & Kennedy 2006).  
As a result, the lack of the above-mentioned information on the relationship 
between the water current and life cycle in this study prevents us from drawing 
conclusions. Thalerosphyrus might need a period of approximately one month 
from the laying of their eggs until the eggs hatch which no nymphs would be 
found in the river. Furthermore, different species populations demonstrate 
different population behaviors especially during the interval between the laying 
and hatching of the eggs. Further studies are needed to better understand the 
complete life cycle of this genus or to gain a greater understanding at the species 
level. 
In summary, the abundance and life history of Thalerosphyrus were 
impacted by water temperature but not by altitude. Cooler water and fast velocity 
were related to the. Higher abundance of Thalerosphyrus found in the Teroi River 
due to the physical characteristics of this river, such as bedrocks and high 
altitude. The Thalerosphyrus in both rivers have at least nine instars with three 
generations (trivoltine). The development of Thalerosphyrus was asynchronous, 
with many overlapping cohorts coexisting in the rivers; thus, many species of 
Thalerosphyrus were pooled together.
