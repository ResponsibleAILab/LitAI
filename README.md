# LitAI
Enhanced Accessibility and Comprehension of Scientific Literature through AI 

Abstractâ€”Information processing and retrieval in literature
are critical for advancing scientific research and knowledge
discovery. The inherent multimodality and diverse formats of
literature, including text, tables, figures, and references, present
significant challenges. This paper introduces LitAI, a novel
approach that employs readily available generative AI tools to
enhance multimodal information retrieval from literature documents. By integrating tools such as optical character recognition
(OCR) with generative AI services, LitAI facilitates the retrieval
of text, tables, figures, and references from PDF documents. We
have developed specific prompts that leverage in-context learning
and prompt engineering within Generative AI to achieve precise
information extraction. Our empirical evaluations, conducted on
datasets from the ecological and biological sciences, demonstrate
the superiority of our approach over several established baselines
including Tesseract-OCR and GPT-4.
